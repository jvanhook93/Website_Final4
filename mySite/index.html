    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
      My name is James Van Hook, I am a 29 year old marine that retired in 2014.
      I graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi with a bachelors
      degree in Marine Biology. I decided that after a few years of working
      offshore that I want to be home more and I have worked a little with
      coding before and have always had an interest in it. I recently got the
      opportunity to be able to return to school and decided that I wanted to do
      a coding bootcamp instead of commiting another 4 years for another
      bachelors degree. I plan on starting a career as a software engineer after
      graduating from this coarse.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>
      I have many hobbies that I enjoy doing whenever I have free time. The
      primary hobby that I have is that I am a scuba diver. I have been scuba
      diving since I was 9 years old and have been certified since I was 11
      years old. I also love to swim. I have been swimming since I was a child
      and before my parents let me scuba dive I had to learn how to swim
      extremely well. Not only my parents but the teachers I had that certified
      me made sure that I was able to swim on my own in case something happened
      when I was out in the water.
